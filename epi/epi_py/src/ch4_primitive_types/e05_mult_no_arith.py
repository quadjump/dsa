# ### 4.5 Compute x * y without arithmetical operators ###

# """
# Sometimes the processors used in ultra low-power devices such as hearing aids do not have
# dedicated hardware for performing multiplication. A program that needs to perform multiplication
# must do so explicitly using lower-level primitives.

# Write a program that multiplies two nonnegative integers. The only operators you are allowed to
# use are
# â€¢ assignment,
# â€¢ the bitwise operators >>, <<, | &, ~ and
# â€¢ equality checks and Boolean combinations thereof.

# You may use loops and functions that you write yourself. These constraints imply, for example,
# that you cannot use increment or decrement, or test if x < y.

# Hint: Add using bitwise operations; multiply using shift-and-add.
