### 13.2 Merge two sorted arrays ###

"""
Suppose you are given two sorted arrays of integers. If one array has enough empty entries at its
end, it can be used to store the combined entries of the two arrays in sorted order. For example,
consider (5,13,17,~,~,~,~,~) and (3,7,11,19), where ~ denotes an empty entry. Then the combined
sorted entries can be stored in the first array as (3,5,7,11,13,17,19,~).

Write a program which takes as input two sorted arrays of integers, and updates the first to the
combined entries of the two arrays in sorted order. Assume the first array has enough empty entries
at its end to hold the result.

Hint: Avoid repeatedly moving entries.
