### 7.4 Test for Overlapping lists (given cycle-free lists) ###

"""
Given two singly linked lists there may be list nodes that are common to both. (This may not be a
bugâ€”it may be desirable from the perspective of reducing memory footprint, as in the flyweight
pattern, or maintaining a canonical form.) For example, the lists in Figure 7.6 on the following page
overlap at Node I.

Write a program that takes two cycle-free singly linked lists, and determines if there exists a node
that is common to both lists.

Hint: Solve the simple cases first.

    Since problem states there are no cycles, any overlap would be one-way (two-way would create cycle)
    Hence both lists end up in the same place.
