### 9.1 Test if a binary tree is height-balanced ###


"""
A binary tree is said to be height-balanced if for each node in the tree, the difference in the height of
its left and right subtrees is at most one. A perfect binary tree is height-balanced, as is a complete
binary tree. A height-balanced binary tree does not have to be perfect or completeâ€”see Figure 9.2
on the next page for an example.

Write a program that takes as input the root of a binary tree and checks whether the tree is height-
balanced.

Hint: Think of a classic binary tree algorithm.
